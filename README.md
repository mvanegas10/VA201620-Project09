# Visual Analytics Project - Group 09

This is the final project of the [Visual Analytics course](http://johnguerra.co/classes/isis_4822_fall_2016/) in [Universidad de los Andes](http://www.uniandes.edu.co/).

This project aims to solve a real problem through a visual analytics application. 

## Project definition

Along this project we will be working with Recaudo Bogotá S.A.S. 

## Data Characterization

We have access to 3 different datasets. 
 1. Ticket stamping: This dataset is a **table**. Each item in the table has 3 **ordered** attributes (card id, TM station id, timestamp) and 1 **categorical** attribute (type of card: personalized, subsidized, ...). 
 2. Amount of times the gate is crossed for leaving the station each 15 minutes: This dataset is a **table**. Each item in the table has 3 **ordered** attributes (amount of occurrences, timestamp and TM station id). 
 3. TM Station's location: This is a **spacial** dataset. Each item has a **geometry** attribute and an **ordered** attribute that represents the TM station id. 
 

## First Solution Approach

- T1. Critical inbound and outbound routes in an specific range of time (rush and free hours) having as origin and destination a TM Station.
- T2. Critical TM Stations dpeending on the amount of people entering during rush hours.
- T3.
